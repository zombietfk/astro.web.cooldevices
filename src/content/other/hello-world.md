# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This my first venture into publishing anything online - this thing was made using Astro and FrontMatterCMS. Watch this space for plenty of future tutorials, ideas, and ramblings of a man on a mission to just make one single darn game!

## About Me

I am a developer of over a decade's experience (Actually almost two decades), based in the UK originally and now in the USA. I have done a lot of programming over the years both as a hobbyist and a professional developer. My resume includes quite a wide breadth of technologies over the years. My career has had a focus on backend technologies with several years of frontend and native mobile development included. But my passion is for game development! And that's just what the focus of this blog will be.

Please join me on my continued journey to explore the world game development, and perhaps I can share my mistakes so you don't have to make them!
